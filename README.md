# quizlet-match-cheats
This cheat is used in quizlet match mode (micromatch) to freeze timer.

# Instructions
[1] Create a bookmark.
[2] Name the bookmark something.
[3] Navigate to the URL section of the bookmark.
[4] Go to script.js in the repository, and copy the code.
[5] However before you put the code in the URL bar, make sure you type this: "javascript:".
[6] And then put the code right after without any spaces.
[7] It should look something like this: javascript:someothercodeafterfromthegithubrepo().

# Usage
After you have installed the cheats, it's time to discuss on how to apply them.
So make sure it's a micromatch game, not a match game. To get micromatch, go to a normal match game but change the URL bar from "match" to "micromatch".
Make sure you click on the bookmark before the start button. At first, it may do nothing. However, after the start button is clicked, it will detect for keyboard key presses. Press any key on the keyboard when you want to instantly win the game. (Initially after game start, it will not do anything. You need to press any key on the keyboard for it to do anything after you start the game.)

# Troubleshooting
So far, there are currently 2 known issues with the code.
Firstly, there is a small glitch where it occasionally will not click all the cards. This glitch is only occasional and refreshing the page or rerunning the cheat may help. Secondly, Quizlet will not register the time if it's under 0.5 seconds. This issue is not due to the cheat. It is actually due to Quizlet's servers. I cannot do anything to treat this problem unless the 0.5 second minimium limit is removed.

HAPPY CHEATING!
