For the developers out there. This code is clearly obfuscated with JSFuck to prevent unauthorized distribution.
However, I guarantee this code snippet is 100% working and effective.

If you are unfamiliar with JSFuck, it is not some kind of April Fools joke.
It is a legitmate way for developers to hide source code (obfuscation).
